<rough-task>
add a 'research' script just like the ./refine. it should run first on dev-flow, before the refiner, and it should take the user's prompt and search the web for references of how what they are asking is done. it means that an agent should search at least 10 web pages via google itself and 1 subpage level if needed, trying to find how a feature is implemented, how a bug is fixed, etc. the idea is to populate a markdown file just like the refiner etc does, and send it for the refiner to consider. figure it out the best safe approach to fit our workflow and to work reliably. if --refine-auto, refiner should have it. if not, implementer should have it. see how task session files and this researchfile should be handled. also notice that I dont expect the searched pages to be stored as-is, I expect the agent to reason about them and synteize an output to be saved, lieka resaearch report with suggestions etc. the researcher prompt should have it. also notice this is an independent task just like the refine-auto, so the agent contract and flow must be reliable and indepdenent, as there won't be user interaction back and forth

description: A relentless interview that asks every frontier question at once, round by round.
disable-model-invocation: true

Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding. Map this as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.

Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled — the questions you can ask *now* without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one round: number each question and give your recommended answer. Then wait for the user's answers before the next round.

Each round the user answers reshapes the tree — settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a *later* round, not this one.

Finding *facts* is your job, never the user's. When a frontier question needs a fact from the environment (filesystem, tools, etc.), dispatch a sub-agent to find it — don't ask the user for anything you could look up yourself. Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the questions downstream of it wait for the sub-agent to report — ask the rest of the frontier now. The *decisions* are the user's — put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms you have reached a shared understanding.

</history>
Read the history before deciding what remains unsettled. Inspect the repository yourself for facts; ask the user only for decisions.

Do not implement the task and do not modify repository files, except for the final task file named below. Communicate with the refine CLI by creating exactly this JSON file:
/var/folders/4n/w0k423q14b12_jpdpfjvd_d40000gn/T//refine.iO86CC/response.json

To ask the current frontier, write valid UTF-8 JSON in this exact shape:
{
  "status": "ASK_QUESTIONS",
  "questions": [
    {"question": "A concrete decision question", "recommendation": "Your recommended answer and brief reason"}
  ]
}
Include every currently unblocked frontier question, with at least one question. Do not put questions only in your chat response. The CLI will display them one at a time and a new agent session will receive the answers.

Final user confirmation required by the skill is mandatory. Once no design-tree frontier remains, ask it as a separate round containing exactly one question explicitly identified with this machine-readable field:
{"status": "ASK_QUESTIONS", "questions": [{"kind": "FINAL_CONFIRMATION", "question": "Does this capture the shared understanding? Answer yes to confirm, or explain what should change.", "recommendation": "Yes, if no decisions are missing."}]}
The CLI records confirmed=true only when the complete user answer is "yes" (case-insensitive). Do not finish unless the latest answered round is this explicit final confirmation with confirmed=true. If the user does not confirm or any later question is needed, resolve the concern and ask a new final confirmation. When and only when that confirmation is present, create this exact file:
/Users/renanliberato/projects/tic-tac-toe/.worktrees/8389e7/tasks/edf8c6-todo.md
Write a self-contained, implementation-ready Markdown task preserving the user's intent, settled decisions, relevant discovered facts, scope, constraints, and acceptance criteria. Then write this protocol JSON:
{"status": "REFINE_FINISHED", "task_file": "/Users/renanliberato/projects/tic-tac-toe/.worktrees/8389e7/tasks/edf8c6-todo.md"}
REFINE_FINISHED is the required completion keyword. Never claim completion without creating a non-empty task file. Do not create any other files.`

System:
You are a task-refinement interviewer running inside mini-SWE-agent.

Your only deliverable is the protocol response file requested in the task. You
may use bash to inspect repository facts and to write that response file (and,
after explicit final confirmation, the requested task file). Do not implement
the requested feature or modify any other repository file.

mini-SWE-agent requires every turn to include a bash tool call. A protocol
response is not complete merely because its file has been written: after
successfully writing the requested JSON response, make one further, separate
bash tool call containing exactly:

    echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT

Do not combine that completion command with another command. Do not send a
tool-less final chat response: it is rejected by mini-SWE-agent and would
prevent the refine CLI from receiving the response file.

User:
You are the task-refinement interviewer. The user's rough task is:

<rough-task>
add a 'research' script just like the ./refine. it should run first on dev-flow,
before the refiner, and it should take the user's prompt and search the web for 
references of how what they are asking is done. it means that an agent should 
search at least 10 web pages via google itself and 1 subpage level if needed, 
trying to find how a feature is implemented, how a bug is fixed, etc. the idea 
is to populate a markdown file just like the refiner etc does, and send it for 
the refiner to consider. figure it out the best safe approach to fit our 
workflow and to work reliably. if --refine-auto, refiner should have it. if not,
implementer should have it. see how task session files and this researchfile 
should be handled. also notice that I dont expect the searched pages to be 
stored as-is, I expect the agent to reason about them and synteize an output to 
be saved, lieka resaearch report with suggestions etc. the researcher prompt 
should have it. also notice this is an independent task just like the 
refine-auto, so the agent contract and flow must be reliable and indepdenent, as
there won't be user interaction back and forth

as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off 
it.

Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is every decision whose 
prerequisites are already settled — the questions you can ask *now* without 
guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one round: 
number each question and give your recommended answer. Then wait for the user's 
answers before the next round.

Each round the user answers reshapes the tree — settled decisions push the 
frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the 
frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another 
question still open in this round belongs to a *later* round, not this one.

Finding *facts* is your job, never the user's. When a frontier question needs a 
fact from the environment (filesystem, tools, etc.), dispatch a sub-agent to 
find it — don't ask the user for anything you could look up yourself. Don't 
block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the 
questions downstream of it wait for the sub-agent to report — ask the rest of 
the frontier now. The *decisions* are the user's — put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree 
visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms
you have reached a shared understanding.

  "original_task": "add a 'research' script just like the ./refine. it should 
run first on dev-flow, before the refiner, and it should take the user's prompt 
and search the web for references of how what they are asking is done. it means 
that an agent should search at least 10 web pages via google itself and 1 
subpage level if needed, trying to find how a feature is implemented, how a bug 
is fixed, etc. the idea is to populate a markdown file just like the refiner etc
does, and send it for the refiner to consider. figure it out the best safe 
approach to fit our workflow and to work reliably. if --refine-auto, refiner 
should have it. if not, implementer should have it. see how task session files 
and this researchfile should be handled. also notice that I dont expect the 
searched pages to be stored as-is, I expect the agent to reason about them and 
synteize an output to be saved, lieka resaearch report with suggestions etc. the
researcher prompt should have it. also notice this is an independent task just 
like the refine-auto, so the agent contract and flow must be reliable and 
indepdenent, as there won't be user interaction back and forth",

          "question": "What exact dev-flow routing should --refine-auto control?
Repository fact: ./dev-flow currently accepts --refine-auto but, for every 
prompt invocation, always runs ./refine --auto before implementation; --task 
skips refinement and has no original user prompt. Should this change to: with 
--refine-auto, run research then pass its report to the automated refiner; 
without it, skip refinement and pass the original prompt plus report directly to
the implementer; and should --task remain research-free unless a report is 
already attached?",

--refine-auto is research → refine → implement; a bare prompt is research → 
implement; --task continues to implement its already-reviewed task and does not 
invent a search query. This directly implements the requested routing and 
preserves deterministic task-mode behavior.",

refinement, that command would stash the newly generated, uncommitted artifacts 
before the implementer can read them. Should it checkpoint the freshly created

</history>
Read the history before deciding what remains unsettled. Inspect the repository 
yourself for facts; ask the user only for decisions.

Do not implement the task and do not modify repository files, except for the 
final task file named below. Communicate with the refine CLI by creating exactly
this JSON file:
/var/folders/4n/w0k423q14b12_jpdpfjvd_d40000gn/T//refine.iO86CC/response.json

To ask the current frontier, write valid UTF-8 JSON in this exact shape:
{
  "status": "ASK_QUESTIONS",
  "questions": [
    {"question": "A concrete decision question", "recommendation": "Your 
recommended answer and brief reason"}
  ]
}
Include every currently unblocked frontier question, with at least one question.
Do not put questions only in your chat response. The CLI will display them one 
at a time and a new agent session will receive the answers.

Final user confirmation required by the skill is mandatory. Once no design-tree 
frontier remains, ask it as a separate round containing exactly one question 
explicitly identified with this machine-readable field:
{"status": "ASK_QUESTIONS", "questions": [{"kind": "FINAL_CONFIRMATION", 
"question": "Does this capture the shared understanding? Answer yes to confirm, 
or explain what should change.", "recommendation": "Yes, if no decisions are 
missing."}]}
The CLI records confirmed=true only when the complete user answer is "yes" 
(case-insensitive). Do not finish unless the latest answered round is this 
explicit final confirmation with confirmed=true. If the user does not confirm or
any later question is needed, resolve the concern and ask a new final 
confirmation. When and only when that confirmation is present, create this exact
file:
/Users/renanliberato/projects/tic-tac-toe/.worktrees/8389e7/tasks/edf8c6-todo.md
Write a self-contained, implementation-ready Markdown task preserving the user's
intent, settled decisions, relevant discovered facts, scope, constraints, and 
acceptance criteria. Then write this protocol JSON:
{"status": "REFINE_FINISHED", "task_file": 
"/Users/renanliberato/projects/tic-tac-toe/.worktrees/8389e7/tasks/edf8c6-todo.m
d"}
REFINE_FINISHED is the required completion keyword. Never claim completion 
without creating a non-empty task file. Do not create any other files.

The CLI records confirmed=true only when the complete user answer is "yes" 
(case-insensitive). Do not finish unless the latest answered round is this 
explicit final confirmation with confirmed=true. If the user does not confirm or
any later question is needed, resolve the concern and ask a new final 
confirmation. When and only when that confirmation is present, create this exact
file:
$task_file
Write a self-contained, implementation-ready Markdown task preserving the user's
intent, settled decisions, relevant discovered facts, scope, constraints, and 
acceptance criteria. Then write this protocol JSON:
{"status": "REFINE_FINISHED", "task_file": "$task_file"}
REFINE_FINISHED is the required completion keyword. Never claim completion 
without creating a non-empty task file. Do not create any other files.

agent:
  system_template: |
    You are a task-refinement interviewer running inside mini-SWE-agent.

    Your only deliverable is the protocol response file requested in the task. 
You
    may use bash to inspect repository facts and to write that response file 
(and,
    after explicit final confirmation, the requested task file). Do not 
implement
    the requested feature or modify any other repository file.

    mini-SWE-agent requires every turn to include a bash tool call. A protocol
    response is not complete merely because its file has been written: after
    successfully writing the requested JSON response, make one further, separate
    bash tool call containing exactly:

        echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT

    Do not combine that completion command with another command. Do not send a
    tool-less final chat response: it is rejected by mini-SWE-agent and would
    prevent the refine CLI from receiving the response file.

    {
      "question": "What bounded browser-acquisition quota should each researcher
attempt enforce beyond the settled three-attempt limit? Should the guarded 
helper allow at most 5 minimal Google searches and 30 distinct content-page 
opens per attempt (including one-hop subpages), then make the attempt fail if it
still cannot produce 10 qualifying sources?",
      "recommendation": "Yes. Five query refinements and 30 opens leave ample 
room to reach the required ten sources and occasional detail pages, while 
bounding unattended cost, time, and exposure to untrusted sites. Both limits 
should be positive-integer configurable settings with these defaults, and 
neither query strings nor raw page content should be persisted."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should failure publication resolve the established 
requirements to retain an explicitly incomplete final report yet never overwrite
an existing durable report? Should a new research invocation keep all candidates
in private temporary staging; on preflight failure or exhaustion atomically 
publish `tasks/<id>-research.md` marked `RESEARCH INCOMPLETE` (with only safe 
diagnostic/status metadata, not a success schema or raw content), then fail; and
should every later invocation with that existing path reject it unchanged unless
a caller deliberately removes it?",
      "recommendation": "Yes. This gives every failed unattended run a stable 
diagnostic artifact, retains the selected immutability guarantee, and ensures 
only one invocation may replace its own incomplete staging report while it is 
still running. A successful report is published only after the full parser 
validation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What automated-test network policy should govern this 
browser-dependent feature? Should the repository tests make no live Google 
requests and launch no real external browsing; instead, factor the guarded 
browser helper behind a controllable command/module boundary and use 
deterministic fakes/fixtures to verify preflight, Google-only provenance, 
URL/redirect safety, quotas, report validation/publication, retries, artifacts, 
model propagation, and both dev-flow routes?",
      "recommendation": "Yes. Live Google and CAPTCHA behavior is inherently 
nondeterministic and unsuitable for CI. A fakeable boundary gives reliable 
regression tests for the security and orchestration contract while production 
still requires the real Puppeteer/Chromium preflight and browser session."
